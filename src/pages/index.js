          Your safety and comfort are our top priority and as such, in-line with
          Government protocols have implemented the following measures:
        </p>
        <h6>Social Distancing</h6>
        <p>Maximum of 6 people when dining in from the same household.</p>
        <p>
          Enforced social distancing with all tables set at a minimum of 1 metre
          apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          We request that diners wear a face mask upon entry until sat a table,
          and would please wear one at all times when not sat at their table (ie
          when visiting restrooms etc).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Guests awaiting tables might be asked to wait outside of the
          restaurant if social distancing and/or occupancy levels require us to
          do so.
        </p>
        <h6>Health & Safety Measures</h6>
        <p>Building upon our existing cleaning and sanitising measures:</p>
        <p>
          Alcohol-based hand sanitisers are available for guest use - throughout
          the restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tables, tableware and chairs are thoroughly sanitised between each use
          prior to seating the next table.
        </p>
        <p>
          All on our team abide by rigorous personal hygiene protocols and wear
          suitable personal protective equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temperature checks will be taken upon arrival and contact details are
          required for all dining in and if necessary will be used to support
          Government track and trace requirements.
        </p>
